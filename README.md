# House Price Prediction Project
This repository contains a case study on predictive modeling, focusing on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. The dataset provides a comprehensive set of housing attributes to train and evaluate the model.

### Key Highlights
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.)
Model Development and Evaluation (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.)
Feature Importance Analysis
Hyperparameter Tuning
Model Deployment (saving the trained model for future use)

### Datasets Used
1. Ames Housing Dataset
Source: AmesHousing.csv
Description: A dataset containing 79 features describing various residential homes in Ames, Iowa.
Target Variable: SalePrice (house price)

## Results
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 15947.05720136519
RÂ² Score: 0.9136076326601522
Key Insights:
  Feature importance indicates that OverallQual and GrLivArea are the most significant predictors of house prices.
